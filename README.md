# Click Improve

When you finish a run, it can be annoying to click the "Improve" button to start another run, especially if you're playing with your HUD off. This plugin clicks that button for you so you can get right back to grinding!

There are some limitations:
- Ony works when playing solo (should be obvious, the "Improve" screen doesn't appear on servers)
- If you do have your HUD off, it needs to be turned back on so the button can be clicked. There is a setting so this plugin can do that for you, but it's possible that it will crash your game whenever it updates. If you have the setting off, the button will be clicked when your turn the HUD back on yourself.
